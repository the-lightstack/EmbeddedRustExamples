# Button Game LED

This code is written for the Raspberry Pi - Pico. To make it work, connect 
a button to gpio15 and ground. 

Hook your pico up to your PC (while holding the BOOTSEL button), run `cargo build`
and then `cargo run`.

The game is stupid, but demonstrates how the `Timer` works as well as Input and 
Output.
